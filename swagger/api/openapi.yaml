    The [Admin Key feature](https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/bypass-access-restrictions-on-a-page-with-admin-key/) is only offered with Confluence Cloud Premium and Enterprise to organization or site admins.

    **NOTE:** Users can only make calls to our public REST APIs using a valid Admin Key by adding the following HTTP header on their requests: `Atl-Confluence-With-Admin-Key: true`. Visit the [Confluence Cloud Changelog](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/changelog/#CHANGE-2480) for more details.

        Returns descendants in the content tree for a given folder by ID in top-to-bottom order (that is, the highest descendant is the first
        item in the response payload). The number of results is limited by the `limit` parameter and additional results (if available)
        will be available by calling this endpoint with the cursor in the response payload. There is also a `depth` parameter specifying depth
        of descendants to be fetched.

        The following types of content will be returned:
        - Database
        - Embed
        - Folder
        - Page
        - Whiteboard

        This endpoint returns minimal information about each descendant. To fetch more details, use a related endpoint based on the content type, such
        as:

    anchor: about
    body: "This is the reference for the Confluence Cloud REST API v2, with definitions\
      \ and performance intended to be an improvement over v1. You can click on the\
      \ meatball menu in the upper right to download the spec or Postman collection."
  - title: Authentication and authorization
    anchor: auth
    body: |-
      **Authentication:** If you are building a Cloud app, authentication is implemented via JWT or Oauth 2.0, depending on what you're building (see [Authentication for apps](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/authentication-for-apps/)). Otherwise, if you are authenticating directly against the REST API, the REST API supports basic auth (see [Basic auth for REST APIs](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/basic-auth-for-rest-apis/)).

      **Authorization:** If you are building a Cloud app, authorization can be implemented by [scopes](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/scopes/) or by [OAuth 2.0 user impersonation](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/oauth-2-jwt-bearer-tokens-for-apps). Otherwise, if you are making calls directly against the REST API, authorization is based on the user used in the authentication process.

      See [Security overview](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/security-overview/) for more details on authentication and authorization.
  - title: Using the REST API
    anchor: using
    body: "**Pagination:** The Confluence REST API v2 uses cursor-based pagination:\
      \ a method that returns a response with multiple objects can only return a limited\
      \ number at one time. This limits the size of responses and conserves server\
      \ resources.\n\nUse the 'limit' and 'cursor' parameters on endpoints that return\
      \ multiple objects to work with pagination. First, make a request with your\
      \ desired limit in the 'limit' parameter, then observe the `Link` header in\
      \ the response. If there are additional entities to be retrieved, the `next`\
      \ URL in the `Link` header will allow you to retrieve the next set of results.\
      \ This relative URL will also be available under the `_links.next` property\
      \ of paginated responses. \n\nFor example, the following request will return\
      \ 5 page objects (if there are 5 present in the target site).\n```\nGET /wiki/api/v2/pages?limit=5\n\
      ```\n\nIf there are additional pages available, the `Link` header will look\
      \ like:\n```\n</wiki/api/v2/pages?limit=5&cursor=<cursor token>>; rel=\"next\"\
      \n```\nThe URL within the `Link` header will allow you to access the next 5\
      \ pages, while the `rel=\"next\"` denotes that the URL refers to the \"next\"\
      \ set of pages. Relations for a single URL are separated by semicolons (;) and\
      \ URLs are separated by commas (,)\nIf there are no related URLs, the `Link`\
      \ header will not be present in the response and neither will the `next` property\
      \ for `_links` in the response body."
